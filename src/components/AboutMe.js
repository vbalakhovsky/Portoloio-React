          I am a painter and I live in New York. I am coming to see the logic and the philosophy of coding that is not as removed from the work process of a painter as I thought. I enjoy how, just like in painting, stepping away from the first intuitive choice sometimes reveals to me the connection between different elements of my work.

It has been a little over four months since I began learning to code. While I still have a long road ahead of me, before I can confidently call myself a full stack developer, I have learned so much. I still feel amazed by the fact that I can write code and it works! During these months I have had success and failure, broke and repaired code. There were times when I stared at the computer screen and didnâ€™t understand a thing, and there were times when the logic of coding sang to me in the lines of JavaScript. Here are my modest, but tremendously gratifying first coding milestones.
